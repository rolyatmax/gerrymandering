 - [ ] Show "close" districts
 - [ ] Render table with % and counts
 - [ ] Clean district files (map NAME => name, etc)
 - [ ] Generate points on backend, send image + sampled set of points for calculations
 - [ ] visualize racial demo and voting outcomes from actual races
 - [ ] change unaffiliated color to purple?
 - [ ] Find missing NC state house district!
 - [ ] zoom?
