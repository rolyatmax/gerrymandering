Gerrymandering ideas

* a gerrymandering game
* look at before/after of districts which have had to be redrawn following court rulings re: racial gerrymandering
  - NC-1
  - NC-12
  - FL-5
* a look at the alleged partisan gerrymandering of Virginia and NC going to Supreme Court now
* invite readers to move the lines themselves
* a look at other algorithmic redrawing methods (compactness, fewer/more districts, etc)


* reach out to Academic about gerrymandering - how to find some data - and chat about how to teach
the concept of gerrymandering to the public - what kind of game might be appropriate
